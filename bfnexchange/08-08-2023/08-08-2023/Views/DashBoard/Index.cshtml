						THE SITE RULES AND REGULATIONS

					<h2>
						PART A - INTRODUCTION

					<h3>

						Use and interpretation
					</h3>
					<p style="font-size: 17px; 	font-weight: 300;	line-height: 1.7em;	color: black !important;	text-align: start;">
						These Rules and Regulations ("Rules") are part of the Site's terms and conditions.

						The Rules apply to all bets placed on this online betting platform ("Site"). The Rules consist of the following:

						This INTRODUCTION section (Part A);
						The GENERAL RULES (set out in Part B below); and
						The SPECIFIC SPORTS RULES (set out in Part C below - these apply to certain sports).
						The General Rules apply to all bets unless stated otherwise in the Specific Sports Rules. If there is any inconsistency between the Specific Sports Rules and the General Rules, the Specific Sports Rules shall prevail.

						The rules governing how markets are offered, managed and/or settled are not the same for every market on each product. In certain circumstances, a bet that is settled as a winner on one product may be settled as a loser on the other product (and vice versa). Additionally, different settlement rules may apply so that, for example, bets that are a winner on one product may be settled as a dead heat or be voided on the other product. Customers must ensure that they familiarise themselves with the relevant rules that apply to the bets that they place on the Site.



					</p>

					<h1>
						Customer responsibility

					</h1>

					<<p style="font-size: 17px; 	font-weight: 300;	line-height: 1.7em;	color: black !important;	text-align: start;">
						Customers should make themselves aware of all of the Rules affecting any market on which they wish to place a bet.
						In particular, customers who use the "one-click" option to place bets are solely responsible for their actions and the Site shall have no liability to such customers for any errors made by customers when using this option.


					</p>

						PART B - GENERAL RULES

						Matters beyond the Site's reasonable control and malfunctions


					</h1>

					<p style="font-size: 17px; 	font-weight: 300;	line-height: 1.7em;	color: black !important;	text-align: start;">

						The Site is not liable for any loss or damage you may suffer because of any: act of God; power cut; trade or labour dispute; act, failure or omission of any government or authority; obstruction or failure of telecommunication services; or any other delay or failure caused by a third party or otherwise outside of our control. In such an event, the Site reserves the right to cancel or suspend access to the Site without incurring any liability.

						The Site is not liable for the failure of any equipment or software howsoever caused, wherever located or administered, or whether under its direct control or not, that may prevent the operation of the Site.

						In the event of a technological failure or error which is apparent to the customer, the customer is obliged to notify the Site of such failure/error immediately. If the customer continues to place a bet in these circumstances, they shall take reasonable action to minimise any potential loss. In the absence of such action, the Site reserves the right to void a bet.

						Site reserves the right to void the bets in any suspicious or appeared to be fixed markets, as Betfair is not accepting bets on Lay Odds in Horseracing markets.

						The Site reserves the right in its absolute discretion to restrict access to the Site, or withhold funds or void any bets outstanding to a customer?s account in its absolute discretion in the event of a technological failure or other malfunction which affects the integrity of the Site whether this is under its direct control or otherwise. Customers will be notified on the Site of any such malfunction which may operate to prevent the placing of further bets or which may result in outstanding bets being voided.

						General

					</h1>

					<p style="font-size: 17px; 	font-weight: 300;	line-height: 1.7em;	color: black !important;	text-align: start;">

						For everything other than horseracing and greyhound racing, if a market is not scheduled to be turned in-play but the Site fails to suspend the market at the relevant time, then:
						if the event has a scheduled 'off' time, all bets matched after that scheduled off time will be void; and
						if the event does not have a scheduled 'off' time, the Site will use its reasonable endeavours to ascertain the time of the actual 'off' and all bets after the time of the 'off' determined by the Site will be void.
						For horseracing and greyhound racing, if a market is? not scheduled to be turned in-play? but the Site fails to suspend the market at the relevant time, then all bets matched after the official 'off' time will be void.
						The Site aims to use its reasonable endeavours to suspend in-play markets at the start of and at the end of the event. However, the Site does not guarantee that such markets will be suspended at the relevant time.
						Customers are responsible for managing their in-play bets at all times.
						For the purposes of in-play betting, customers should be aware that transmissions described as "live" by some broadcasters may actually be delayed or pre-recorded. The extent of any delay may vary depending on the set-up through which they are receiving pictures or data.

					</p>

					<h1>

						All markets other than soccer markets - not suspending at the time of the 'off'

					</h1>

					<p style="font-size: 17px; 	font-weight: 300;	line-height: 1.7em;	color: black !important;	text-align: start;">
						In relation to markets which are? scheduled to be turned in-play, the Site aims to use its reasonable endeavours to turn such markets in-play at the time of the 'off'. However, the Site does not guarantee that such markets will be suspended and turned in-play at the time of the 'off'.
						If a market is scheduled to be turned in-play but the Site does not suspend the market and cancel unmatched bets at the time of the 'off'? and? the market is not turned in-play with unmatched bets cancelled at any time during the event, all bets matched after the scheduled time of the 'off' will be void (in the case of horseracing and greyhound racing, bets will be void from the official rather than the scheduled 'off' time). If the event does not have a scheduled 'off' time, the Site will use its reasonable endeavours to ascertain the time of the actual 'off' and all bets after the time of the 'off' determined by the Site will be void.
						If a market is scheduled to be turned in-play but the Site does not suspend the market at the time of the 'off' (so unmatched bets are not cancelled at that time), but the market is intentionally turned in-play at a later time during the event, all bets matched after the time of the 'off' will stand.

					<h1>

						Soccer markets - not suspending at kick-off or on the occurrence of a Material Event and rules relating to VAR

					</h1>

					<p style="font-size: 17px; 	font-weight: 300;	line-height: 1.7em;	color: black !important;	text-align: start;">

						Not suspending at kick-off
						In relation to soccer markets that are scheduled to be turned in-play, the Site aims to use its reasonable endeavours to turn such markets in-play at kick-off and to suspend such markets on the occurrence of a Material Event (see definition of "Material Event" below).
						The Site does not guarantee that such markets will be suspended and turned in-play at kick-off.
						If a market is scheduled to be turned in-play but the Site does not suspend the market at kick-off and the market is not turned in-play at any time during the match, all bets matched after the scheduled time of the kick-off will be void.
						If a market is scheduled to be turned in-play but the Site does not suspend the market at kick-off (so unmatched bets are not cancelled at that time), but the market is turned in-play at a later time during the match, all bets matched after the scheduled time of the kick-off and before the first "Material Event" will stand. However, if there has been one or more "Material Events", any bets matched between the first "Material Event" and the market being turned in-play will be void.
						Not suspending on the occurrence of a Material Event and cancellations of Material Events due to VAR
						If the Site does not suspend a market on time for the occurrence of a Material Event, the Site reserves the right to void bets unfairly matched after the Material Event has occurred. Voiding of these bets may take place during the event or retrospectively once a game is completed.
						Where a Material Event is cancelled due to a determination made via a video assistant referee, the Site will void all bets which are matched between the occurrence of the Material Event and the cancellation of it. The voiding of any such bets may take place during the event or retrospectively once a game is completed.
						Definition of "Material Event"
						For the purpose of these Rules, a "Material Event" shall mean a goal being scored, a penalty being awarded or a player being sent off.

					</p>

					<h1>

						Results and market settlement

					</h1>

					<h2>

						General
					</h2>

					<p style="font-size: 17px; 	font-weight: 300;	line-height: 1.7em;	color: black !important;	text-align: start;">

						Markets will be settled in accordance as set out in the Specific Sports Rules. Markets would be settled on all Matched Bets only.
						Where the Specific Sports Rules do not specify how and on what basis a market will be settled, markets will be settled on the official result of the relevant governing body regardless of any subsequent disqualification or amendment to the result (except if an amendment is announced within 24 hours of the initial settlement of the relevant market in order to correct an error in reporting the result).
						If no official result of a relevant governing body is available, the result will be determined by the Site (acting reasonably) using information from independent sources. In such cases, if any new information comes into the public domain within 48 hours of settlement, then the Site shall (acting reasonably) determine either: (i) whether the market should be reinstated or resettled in light of this new information; or (ii) whether or not to wait for further information before deciding whether to reinstate or resettle the market. Except where the Site has announced that it is waiting for further information, any information that comes into the public domain more than 48 hours after a market has been settled shall not be considered by the Site (regardless of whether or not such information may have led to a different result).
						In the event of any uncertainty about any result or potential result, the Site reserves the right to suspend settlement of any market for an unlimited period until the uncertainty can be resolved to the reasonable satisfaction of the Site. The Site reserves the right to void any market if the uncertainty regarding settlement cannot be resolved to the Site's reasonable satisfaction.

					</p>

					<h2>
						Resettlements

					</h2>

					<p style="font-size: 17px; 	font-weight: 300;	line-height: 1.7em;	color: black !important;	text-align: start;">
						Markets are generally settled shortly after the end of the event in question. the Site may settle (or part-settle) some markets before the official result is declared (or may increase a customer's 'available to bet' balance by the minimum potential winnings of that customer on a given market) purely as a customer service benefit. However, the Site reserves the right to amend the settlement of the market if: (i) the official result is different to the result on which the Site initially settled the market; or (ii) if the whole market is eventually voided (e.g. for an abandoned event).
						The Site reserves the right to reverse the settlement of a market if a market is settled in error (for example, a human or technical error).
						If The Site resettles a market, this may lead to amendments being made to a customer's balance to reflect changes in market settlement.


					</p>

					<h2>

						Non-runners, withdrawals and disqualifications
					</h2>
					<p style="font-size: 17px; 	font-weight: 300;	line-height: 1.7em;	color: black !important;	text-align: start;">

						Subject always to the Site's right to void bets under its terms and conditions or for any exception under the Rules, if a market contains a statement that says "All bets stand, run or not" (or something similar), then all bets on a team or competitor will stand regardless of whether or not the team or competitor starts the event or takes any part in the event.
						If a team or competitor is disqualified, withdraws or forfeits after starting an event they will be deemed a loser providing at least one other team or competitor completes the event. If no team or competitor completes an event (having started) then all bets will be void except for bets on any markets which have been unconditionally determined.

					</p>

					<h2>

						Winner with [named selection]' markets
					</h2>

					<p style="font-size: 17px; 	font-weight: 300;	line-height: 1.7em;	color: black !important;	text-align: start;">

						The Site may from time to time offer markets that are dependent on the participation of a particular competitor. If the competitor named in a 'Winner with ?' market title does not participate in the tournament or event then all bets on the market will be void.
						A team or competitor will be deemed to have participated if they have taken part to the extent necessary to record an official result or classification (including any disqualification but excluding any "did not start" or equivalent classification).

					</p>

					<h2>

						Abandonments, Cancellations, Postponements

					</h2>

					<p style="font-size: 17px; 	font-weight: 300;	line-height: 1.7em;	color: black !important;	text-align: start;">

						Some markets have different rules and these are listed in the Specific Sports Rules. However, where a market has no rules in the Specific Sports Rules in relation to an abandonment, cancellation and/or postponement the following shall apply.

						In relation to any match, fixture, game, individual event, or similar: If the event is not completed within three days after the scheduled completion date, then all bets on markets for this event will be void, except for bets on any markets that have been unconditionally determined.

						In relation to any tournament, competition or similar: If the event is not completed within three days after the scheduled completion date, then any markets relating to the event will be settled in accordance with the official ruling of the relevant governing body, providing such a decision is given within 90 days after the scheduled completion date. If no official ruling is announced in this 90 day period, then bets on any market relating to this event will be void, except for bets on any markets which have been unconditionally determined. If a market is to be voided but has been part-settled as a courtesy to customers, then such part-settled bets will be reversed and all bets on the market will be void.

						The Site will decide (acting reasonably) whether a market relates to a match (or similar) or a tournament (or similar).


					</p>

					<h2>

						Change of venue
					</h2>

					<p style="font-size: 17px; 	font-weight: 300;	line-height: 1.7em;	color: black !important;	text-align: start;">
						Some markets have different rules and these are listed in the Specific Sports Rules.

						However, if change of venue is not dealt with in the Specific Sports Rules then the following shall apply:

						For any team sport: if the scheduled venue is changed after the market is loaded by the Site, all bets will be void only if the new venue is a home ground of the original away team
						For all categories or markets other than team sports: if the scheduled venue is changed after the market is loaded by the Site, all bets will stand.
						If there is a change in the type of scheduled surface after the market has been loaded, all bets will stand.


					</p>

					<h2>

						Periods of time
					</h2>

					<p style="font-size: 17px; 	font-weight: 300;	line-height: 1.7em;	color: black !important;	text-align: start;">

						Some markets have different rules and these are listed in the Specific Sports Rules. However, if not dealt with in the Specific Sports Rules then the following shall apply.

						If the scheduled duration of an event is changed after the market has been loaded but before the start of the event, then all bets will be void.

						Some markets refer to the length of time until an occurrence in the event (e.g. time of first goal). If an event happens in stoppage or injury time after any regular time period then it will be deemed to have occurred at the end of the regular time period. For example, if a goal is scored in first half stoppage-time in a soccer match it will be deemed to have occurred on 45 minutes.

						All bets apply to the relevant full 'regular time' period including stoppage time. Any extra-time and/or penalty shoot-out is not included.

						References within these Rules to a particular number of 'days' shall mean the end of the day local time after the expiry of the specified number of days.
					</p>

					<h2>

						"To qualify" markets
					</h2>

					<p style="font-size: 17px; 	font-weight: 300;	line-height: 1.7em;	color: black !important;	text-align: start;">

						Some markets have different rules and these are listed in the Specific Sports Rules. However, if not dealt with in the Specific Sports Rules then the following shall apply.

						Any 'to qualify' market (e.g. "to reach the final" markets) will be determined by the competitor or team that qualifies, whether or not they take part in the next round or event for which they have qualified. Markets will be settled after the qualifying stage and any subsequent disqualification or amendment to the result will not count.
					</p>

					<h2>

						Dead heats
					</h2>

					<p style="font-size: 17px; 	font-weight: 300;	line-height: 1.7em;	color: black !important;	text-align: start;">
						Unless stated otherwise in the Specific Sports Rules the Dead Heat Rule applies to bets on a market where there are more winners than expected.

						For each bet matched on a relevant winning selection, the stake money is first reduced in proportion by multiplying it by the sum of the number of winners expected, divided by the number of actual winners (i.e. stake multiplied by (number of winners expected/number of actual winners)). The winnings are then paid to the successful backers on this 'reduced stake' (reduced stake multiplied by traded price) and the remaining stake money is paid to the appropriate layers.


					</p>

					<h2>

						Miscellaneous
					</h2>

					<p style="font-size: 17px; 	font-weight: 300;	line-height: 1.7em;	color: black !important;	text-align: start;">

						All references to time periods in the Rules relate to the time zone in which the event takes place. For example, a reference to the start time of a football match, relates to the local kick-off time.
						All information supplied by the Site is done so in good faith. However, the Site cannot accept liability for any errors or omissions in respect of any information, such as the posting of prices, runners, times, scores, results or general statistics.
						The Site reserves the right to correct any obvious errors and shall take all reasonable steps to ensure markets are administered with integrity and transparency.
						If an incorrect team or competitor name is displayed (excluding minor spelling mistakes) or the incorrect number of teams, competitors or outcomes is displayed in any complete market or a market is otherwise loaded using incorrect information or includes any obvious error, then the Site reserves the right to suspend the market and (providing it acts reasonably) to void all bets matched on the market.
						Customers are responsible for ensuring that they satisfy themselves that the selection on which they place a bet is their intended selection. For example, in the case of a competitor bearing the same name as another individual not competing in the relevant event, the onus is on the customer to ensure that they know which competitor the Site has loaded into the relevant market and to ensure that they are placing their bet on their chosen competitor.

					<h3>

						Use and interpretation
					</h3>
					<p style="font-size: 17px; 	font-weight: 300;	line-height: 1.7em;	color: black !important;	text-align: start;">
						These Rules and Regulations ("Rules") are part of the Site's terms and conditions.

						The Rules apply to all bets placed on this online betting platform ("Site"). The Rules consist of the following:

						This INTRODUCTION section (Part A);
						The GENERAL RULES (set out in Part B below); and
						The SPECIFIC SPORTS RULES (set out in Part C below - these apply to certain sports).
						The General Rules apply to all bets unless stated otherwise in the Specific Sports Rules. If there is any inconsistency between the Specific Sports Rules and the General Rules, the Specific Sports Rules shall prevail.

						The rules governing how markets are offered, managed and/or settled are not the same for every market on each product. In certain circumstances, a bet that is settled as a winner on one product may be settled as a loser on the other product (and vice versa). Additionally, different settlement rules may apply so that, for example, bets that are a winner on one product may be settled as a dead heat or be voided on the other product. Customers must ensure that they familiarise themselves with the relevant rules that apply to the bets that they place on the Site.

					<h1>
						Customer responsibility

					</h1>

					<<p style="font-size: 17px; 	font-weight: 300;	line-height: 1.7em;	color: black !important;	text-align: start;">
						Customers should make themselves aware of all of the Rules affecting any market on which they wish to place a bet.

If the customer continues to place a bet in these circumstances, they shall take reasonable action to minimise any potential loss.

					<p style="font-size: 17px; 	font-weight: 300;	line-height: 1.7em;	color: black !important;	text-align: start;">

						For everything other than horseracing and greyhound racing, if a market is not scheduled to be turned in-play but the Site fails to suspend the market at the relevant time, then:
						if the event has a scheduled 'off' time, all bets matched after that scheduled off time will be void; and
						if the event does not have a scheduled 'off' time, the Site will use its reasonable endeavours to ascertain the time of the actual 'off' and all bets after the time of the 'off' determined by the Site will be void.
						For horseracing and greyhound racing, if a market is? not scheduled to be turned in-play? but the Site fails to suspend the market at the relevant time, then all bets matched after the official 'off' time will be void.
						The Site aims to use its reasonable endeavours to suspend in-play markets at the start of and at the end of the event. However, the Site does not guarantee that such markets will be suspended at the relevant time.
						Customers are responsible for managing their in-play bets at all times.
						For the purposes of in-play betting, customers should be aware that transmissions described as "live" by some broadcasters may actually be delayed or pre-recorded. The extent of any delay may vary depending on the set-up through which they are receiving pictures or data.

						All markets other than soccer markets - not suspending at the time of the 'off'

					</h1>

					<p style="font-size: 17px; 	font-weight: 300;	line-height: 1.7em;	color: black !important;	text-align: start;">
						In relation to markets which are? scheduled to be turned in-play, the Site aims to use its reasonable endeavours to turn such markets in-play at the time of the 'off'. However, the Site does not guarantee that such markets will be suspended and turned in-play at the time of the 'off'.
						If a market is scheduled to be turned in-play but the Site does not suspend the market and cancel unmatched bets at the time of the 'off'? and? the market is not turned in-play with unmatched bets cancelled at any time during the event, all bets matched after the scheduled time of the 'off' will be void (in the case of horseracing and greyhound racing, bets will be void from the official rather than the scheduled 'off' time). If the event does not have a scheduled 'off' time, the Site will use its reasonable endeavours to ascertain the time of the actual 'off' and all bets after the time of the 'off' determined by the Site will be void.
						If a market is scheduled to be turned in-play but the Site does not suspend the market at the time of the 'off' (so unmatched bets are not cancelled at that time), but the market is intentionally turned in-play at a later time during the event, all bets matched after the time of the 'off' will stand.

					</h1>

					<p style="font-size: 17px; 	font-weight: 300;	line-height: 1.7em;	color: black !important;	text-align: start;">

						Not suspending at kick-off
						In relation to soccer markets that are scheduled to be turned in-play, the Site aims to use its reasonable endeavours to turn such markets in-play at kick-off and to suspend such markets on the occurrence of a Material Event (see definition of "Material Event" below).
						The Site does not guarantee that such markets will be suspended and turned in-play at kick-off.
						If a market is scheduled to be turned in-play but the Site does not suspend the market at kick-off and the market is not turned in-play at any time during the match, all bets matched after the scheduled time of the kick-off will be void.
						If a market is scheduled to be turned in-play but the Site does not suspend the market at kick-off (so unmatched bets are not cancelled at that time), but the market is turned in-play at a later time during the match, all bets matched after the scheduled time of the kick-off and before the first "Material Event" will stand. However, if there has been one or more "Material Events", any bets matched between the first "Material Event" and the market being turned in-play will be void.
						Not suspending on the occurrence of a Material Event and cancellations of Material Events due to VAR
						If the Site does not suspend a market on time for the occurrence of a Material Event, the Site reserves the right to void bets unfairly matched after the Material Event has occurred. Voiding of these bets may take place during the event or retrospectively once a game is completed.
						Where a Material Event is cancelled due to a determination made via a video assistant referee, the Site will void all bets which are matched between the occurrence of the Material Event and the cancellation of it. The voiding of any such bets may take place during the event or retrospectively once a game is completed.
						Definition of "Material Event"
						For the purpose of these Rules, a "Material Event" shall mean a goal being scored, a penalty being awarded or a player being sent off.

						Results and market settlement

					</h1>

					<h2>

						General
					</h2>

					<p style="font-size: 17px; 	font-weight: 300;	line-height: 1.7em;	color: black !important;	text-align: start;">

						Markets will be settled in accordance as set out in the Specific Sports Rules. Markets would be settled on all Matched Bets only.
						Where the Specific Sports Rules do not specify how and on what basis a market will be settled, markets will be settled on the official result of the relevant governing body regardless of any subsequent disqualification or amendment to the result (except if an amendment is announced within 24 hours of the initial settlement of the relevant market in order to correct an error in reporting the result).
						If no official result of a relevant governing body is available, the result will be determined by the Site (acting reasonably) using information from independent sources. In such cases, if any new information comes into the public domain within 48 hours of settlement, then the Site shall (acting reasonably) determine either: (i) whether the market should be reinstated or resettled in light of this new information; or (ii) whether or not to wait for further information before deciding whether to reinstate or resettle the market. Except where the Site has announced that it is waiting for further information, any information that comes into the public domain more than 48 hours after a market has been settled shall not be considered by the Site (regardless of whether or not such information may have led to a different result).
						In the event of any uncertainty about any result or potential result, the Site reserves the right to suspend settlement of any market for an unlimited period until the uncertainty can be resolved to the reasonable satisfaction of the Site. The Site reserves the right to void any market if the uncertainty regarding settlement cannot be resolved to the Site's reasonable satisfaction.

					</p>

					<h2>
						Resettlements

					</h2>

					<p style="font-size: 17px; 	font-weight: 300;	line-height: 1.7em;	color: black !important;	text-align: start;">
						Markets are generally settled shortly after the end of the event in question. the Site may settle (or part-settle) some markets before the official result is declared (or may increase a customer's 'available to bet' balance by the minimum potential winnings of that customer on a given market) purely as a customer service benefit. However, the Site reserves the right to amend the settlement of the market if: (i) the official result is different to the result on which the Site initially settled the market; or (ii) if the whole market is eventually voided (e.g. for an abandoned event).
						The Site reserves the right to reverse the settlement of a market if a market is settled in error (for example, a human or technical error).
						If The Site resettles a market, this may lead to amendments being made to a customer's balance to reflect changes in market settlement.

						Non-runners, withdrawals and disqualifications
					</h2>
					<p style="font-size: 17px; 	font-weight: 300;	line-height: 1.7em;	color: black !important;	text-align: start;">

						Subject always to the Site's right to void bets under its terms and conditions or for any exception under the Rules, if a market contains a statement that says "All bets stand, run or not" (or something similar), then all bets on a team or competitor will stand regardless of whether or not the team or competitor starts the event or takes any part in the event.
						If a team or competitor is disqualified, withdraws or forfeits after starting an event they will be deemed a loser providing at least one other team or competitor completes the event. If no team or competitor completes an event (having started) then all bets will be void except for bets on any markets which have been unconditionally determined.

						The Site may from time to time offer markets that are dependent on the participation of a particular competitor. If the competitor named in a 'Winner with ?' market title does not participate in the tournament or event then all bets on the market will be void.
						A team or competitor will be deemed to have participated if they have taken part to the extent necessary to record an official result or classification (including any disqualification but excluding any "did not start" or equivalent classification).

						Abandonments, Cancellations, Postponements

					</h2>

					<p style="font-size: 17px; 	font-weight: 300;	line-height: 1.7em;	color: black !important;	text-align: start;">

If no official ruling is announced in this 90 day period, then bets on any market relating to this event will be void, except for bets on any markets which have been unconditionally determined. If a market is to be voided but has been part-settled as a courtesy to customers, then such part-settled bets will be reversed and all bets on the market will be void.

						However, if change of venue is not dealt with in the Specific Sports Rules then the following shall apply:

						If the scheduled duration of an event is changed after the market has been loaded but before the start of the event, then all bets will be void.

						Some markets refer to the length of time until an occurrence in the event (e.g. time of first goal). If an event happens in stoppage or injury time after any regular time period then it will be deemed to have occurred at the end of the regular time period. For example, if a goal is scored in first half stoppage-time in a soccer match it will be deemed to have occurred on 45 minutes.

						All bets apply to the relevant full 'regular time' period including stoppage time. Any extra-time and/or penalty shoot-out is not included.

						References within these Rules to a particular number of 'days' shall mean the end of the day local time after the expiry of the specified number of days.

						Some markets have different rules and these are listed in the Specific Sports Rules. However, if not dealt with in the Specific Sports Rules then the following shall apply.

						Any 'to qualify' market (e.g. "to reach the final" markets) will be determined by the competitor or team that qualifies, whether or not they take part in the next round or event for which they have qualified. Markets will be settled after the qualifying stage and any subsequent disqualification or amendment to the result will not count.
					</p>

					<h2>

						Dead heats
					</h2>

					<p style="font-size: 17px; 	font-weight: 300;	line-height: 1.7em;	color: black !important;	text-align: start;">
						Unless stated otherwise in the Specific Sports Rules the Dead Heat Rule applies to bets on a market where there are more winners than expected.

						For each bet matched on a relevant winning selection, the stake money is first reduced in proportion by multiplying it by the sum of the number of winners expected, divided by the number of actual winners (i.e. stake multiplied by (number of winners expected/number of actual winners)). The winnings are then paid to the successful backers on this 'reduced stake' (reduced stake multiplied by traded price) and the remaining stake money is paid to the appropriate layers.


					</p>

					<h2>

						Miscellaneous
					</h2>

					<p style="font-size: 17px; 	font-weight: 300;	line-height: 1.7em;	color: black !important;	text-align: start;">

						All references to time periods in the Rules relate to the time zone in which the event takes place. For example, a reference to the start time of a football match, relates to the local kick-off time.
						All information supplied by the Site is done so in good faith. However, the Site cannot accept liability for any errors or omissions in respect of any information, such as the posting of prices, runners, times, scores, results or general statistics.
						The Site reserves the right to correct any obvious errors and shall take all reasonable steps to ensure markets are administered with integrity and transparency.
						If an incorrect team or competitor name is displayed (excluding minor spelling mistakes) or the incorrect number of teams, competitors or outcomes is displayed in any complete market or a market is otherwise loaded using incorrect information or includes any obvious error, then the Site reserves the right to suspend the market and (providing it acts reasonably) to void all bets matched on the market.
						Customers are responsible for ensuring that they satisfy themselves that the selection on which they place a bet is their intended selection. For example, in the case of a competitor bearing the same name as another individual not competing in the relevant event, the onus is on the customer to ensure that they know which competitor the Site has loaded into the relevant market and to ensure that they are placing their bet on their chosen competitor.
						The Site may, in its sole and absolute discretion, decide to suspend betting on a market at any time (even if such suspension is earlier than anticipated by the Rules). In the interests of maintaining integrity and fairness in the markets, the Site may also void certain bets in a market or void a whole market in its entirety.
						In the event that members are unable to place bets due to technical issues or for any other reason, the Site has no obligation to accept bets in an alternate manner. Any bets attempted to be placed in another manner will not be accepted.
						The Site reserves the right to void any bets placed on markets where an incorrect price or line was offered.
						The Site reserves the right to close or suspend a customer?s account if it considers that that customer has used the Site in an unfair manner, has deliberately cheated or taken unfair advantage or if the customer?s account is being used for the benefit of a third party. The Site also reserves the right to close or suspend a customer?s account if it considers that it has been used in a fraudulent manner or for illegal and/or unlawful or improper purposes.
						The Site reserves the right to amend the Rules at any time. Any such revision will be binding and effective immediately on the posting of such rule changes on the Site and any markets loaded after the new Rules have been posted shall be governed by the new Rules.
						The Site reserves the right to cancel unmatched bets to protect customers at any time.
						The Site shall use its reasonable endeavours to resolve disputes and shall act with fairness and integrity in exercising its rights under these rules. The Site?s decision in such cases shall be final and binding upon the customer.
						On the settlement of any market, amounts relating to:
						winnings/losses on bets; and
						any charges
						will be rounded up or down to the nearest two decimal places

					</p>

					<h2>

						Multiple accounts
					</h2>

					<p style="font-size: 17px; 	font-weight: 300;	line-height: 1.7em;	color: black !important;	text-align: start;">
						Customers are not permitted to hold multiple accounts. This includes holding an account with any other site operating on the same platform as this Site.

						Customers who continue to operate multiple accounts will have their accounts "linked" and managed accordingly which may affect the extent to which bets can be placed on the Site.

						If the Site believes, in its absolute discretion, that customers have registered and/or used more than one account, and/or acted in collusion with one or more other individuals through a number of different accounts, the Site reserves the right to void bets and/or withhold any winnings arising from such a behaviour.


					</p>

					<h2>

						Use of Virtual Private Network (VPN) and Proxy Servers

					</h2>

					<p style="font-size: 17px; 	font-weight: 300;	line-height: 1.7em;	color: black !important;	text-align: start;">
						Customers using VPN applications to mask location or proxy servers to mask device are liable to having bets invalidated.

						Customers appearing from multiple IP locations are also liable to having bets invalidated.


					</p>


					<h2>

						Cheating/Sniping
					</h2>

					<p style="font-size: 17px; 	font-weight: 300;	line-height: 1.7em;	color: black !important;	text-align: start;">
						Cheating of any kind is not allowed and customers bets who are deemed to be cheating are liable to have bets made void.

						Cheating includes but is not limited to; market price manipulation, court siding, sniping, use of any kind of VPN and commission abuse.


					</p>

					<h2>
						Integrity
					</h2>
					<p style="font-size: 17px; 	font-weight: 300;	line-height: 1.7em;	color: black !important;	text-align: start;">

						The Site reserves the right to void any bets that are under review as part of any integrity investigation.

						The Site may void certain bets in a market or void a whole market in its entirety as a result of any integrity investigation.

						The Site?s decision in such integrity cases shall be final and binding upon the customer.

						Cricket

					</h2>

					<h3>General</h3>

					<p style="font-size: 17px; 	font-weight: 300;	line-height: 1.7em;	color: black !important;	text-align: start;">
						If a ball is not bowled during a competition, series or match then all bets will be void except for those on any market that has been unconditionally determined (e.g. in the 'Completed Match' market).
						If a match is shortened by weather, all bets will be settled according to the official result (including for limited overs matches, the result determined by the Duckworth Lewis method).
						In the event of a match being decided by a bowl-off or toss of the coin, all bets will be void except for those on markets that have been unconditionally determined.

					</p>

					<h3>Test matches</h3>
					<p style="font-size: 17px; 	font-weight: 300;	line-height: 1.7em;	color: black !important;	text-align: start;">
						If a match starts but is later abandoned for any reason other than weather (which may include but is not limited to: dangerous or unplayable wicket or outfield; pitch vandalism; strike or boycott; crowd protests/violence; stadium damage; acts of terrorism; and acts of God), the Site reserves the right to void all bets, except for those on markets that have been unconditionally determined.
						If the match is not scheduled to be completed within five days after the original scheduled completion date, then all bets on markets for this event will be void, except for bets on any markets that have been unconditionally determined.

					</p>

					<h3>
						Limited Over matches
					</h3>
					<p style="font-size: 17px; 	font-weight: 300;	line-height: 1.7em;	color: black !important;	text-align: start;">
						If a match is declared "No Result'', bets will be void on all markets for the event except for those markets which have been unconditionally determined or where the minimum number of overs have been bowled as laid out in the market specific information.
						In the event of a new toss taking place on a scheduled reserve day for a limited overs match all bets that were placed after 30 minutes before the original scheduled start of play on the first day will be made void. This rule relates to all markets except those that have been unconditionally determined (e.g. in the win the toss and toss combination markets).
						The Site will void all Super Over bets in the event of a tied Super Over regardless of settlement rules elsewhere.
					</p>

					<h3>Completed Match</h3>

					<p style="font-size: 17px; 	font-weight: 300;	line-height: 1.7em;	color: black !important;	text-align: start;">
						A match will be treated as "Completed" when the required number of overs for that game have been completed as determined by the match officials. If the required number of overs for that match has not been completed, the match will be treated as "Match Abandoned" or "No Result" and bets will be settled accordingly.
						Please be aware that bets will carry over onto any reserve day and will be settled on the official result of the match. If a match is postponed or abandoned for any reason other than weather (which may include but is not limited to: dangerous or unplayable wicket or outfield; pitch vandalism; strike or boycott; crowd protests/violence; stadium damage; acts of terrorism; and acts of God), The Site reserves the right to void all bets on this market.

					</p>
					<h3>
						Sessions/Innings/Player Runs - Fancy
					</h3>

					<p style="font-size: 17px; 	font-weight: 300;	line-height: 1.7em;	color: black !important;	text-align: start;">
						All session/innings/player runs are based on Haar-Jeet odds format.
						In the event of rain reduced innings:
						If an innings is curtailed before the original scheduled start of play, all bets will be settled.
						If an innings is curtailed after start of play, then all bets on markets for this event will be settled up to the stipulated new innings length.
						In any session market, in the event a session is not completed in full because a team is all out or declared, all bets will remain valid and the market will be settled at the innings score.
						For Advance Session markets denoted by 'ADV' in market name only the 1st team to bat Innings markets are valid. For Test Matches the 1st innings for each team is valid.
						We endeavour to suspended all ADV markets during the toss but this is not guaranteed for all events and dependent on media coverage. The site reserves the right to void bets deemed to take advantage of information not generally available.
						If any fixture is subject to conditions that may alter the length, structure or format of the fixture in any manner (e.g. rain), ADV markets may be suspended.
						Batsman Runs - bets will stand if the batsman has faced one ball or is given out before first ball is faced. Score counts if batsman is Not-Out including if innings is declared. In case of rain, match abandoned etc. settled bets will be valid.
						Runs at Fall of 1st Wicket ? This market will be settled based on the total number of runs scored at the fall of the first wicket. At least one ball must be bowled, if no wickets fall bets will be void unless settlement is already determined.
						Runs at Fall of Next Wicket - The score before the fall of the specified wicket determines the result of the market. If a team declares or reaches their target then the score at the conclusion of the innings will determine the settlement of the bets. Bets will be void should no more play take place following the intervention of rain, or any other delay, as the ability to reach previous quotes offered will have been removed. In case of rain, match abandoned etc. settled bets will be valid.
						Over Total Runs ? Bets will be settled on the total number of runs scored during the 1st over of the match. The over must be completed for bets to stand unless settlement is already determined.
						In the instance that a market is not suspended upon the completion of the market, all bets placed after the time of completion may be made void.
						ADV Opening Batsmen markets are only valid if the batsmen selected in the market opens the batting. If the opening batsmen change, then the opening batsmen market in relation to the particular player who was changed will be made void.
						Extras and penalty runs will be included for settlement purposes with the exception of penalty runs awarded due to a slow over rate which will be excluded

					</p>

					<h3>
						Format Specific Session Runs Rules

					</h3>

					<p style="font-size: 17px; 	font-weight: 300;	line-height: 1.7em;	color: black !important;	text-align: start;">
						Test Matches (Meter Paari) - All bets, open or closed, on a team?s innings runs shall be void if 70 full overs are not bowled unless one team has won, is dismissed or declares prior to that point.
						ADV markets for both teams will be valid in test matches, regardless of which team bats first.
						Where a session is open for a nominated number of overs but the team declare before the end of that session, the session is made complete by the remaining number of balls from the opposing team?s innings that follows the declaration.
						Day 1, session 1, a minimum of 25 overs must be bowled, otherwise all bets in this session market will be void.
						Day 1, session 2, a minimum of 25 overs must be bowled, otherwise all bets in this session market will be void.
						1st Day Total Run markets will only be valid if a minimum of 80 overs are bowled on this day. Otherwise all bets in this market will be void.
						Test Matches - (PLAYERS METER) Individual Batsmen Runs / Partnerships - All bets, open or closed, on an individual batsman or partnership runs shall be void if 50 full overs are not bowled unless one team has won, is dismissed or declares prior to that point. Bets on partnership totals make up when the next wicket falls. If a batsman in the relevant partnership retires hurt, the partnership is treated as continuing between the remaining batsman and the batsman who comes to the wicket. A partnership is also treated as being ended by the end of an innings.
						Total Match Four, Total Match Sixes, Total Match Runs, Total Match Wides, Total Match Extras, Total Match Wicket, Top Batsmen, Highest Over, Innings Designated Line Markets will only be valid if the third innings is played. Otherwise, all bets will be void.
						Next Batsman Out markets - if a player retires injured, bets will be void in this market.


						Limited Overs Matches - (Player Meter), Individual Batsmen Runs or Partnerships - In a limited overs match where bets may be made on an individual batsman or partnership runs in-play and the innings is curtailed or subject to any reduction in overs, then these markets will be settled at the midpoint of the last available quote before the overs were reduced. If the innings resumes at a later time, a new market may be formed. If a customer wants a position in the new market they are required to place a new bet. If there are any subsequent reductions in overs, exactly the same rules will continue to apply i.e. the market is settled at the midpoint of the last available quote before the overs were reduced and a new market may be formed.
						Total Match Four,Total Match Sixes, Total Match Runs, Total Match Wides, Total Match Extras, Total Match Wicket, Top Batsmen, Highest Over, Innings Designated Line Markets will only be valid if the second innings is played. Otherwise, all bets will be void.
						In the event of an inning length being altered due to rain, match abandonment or any other condition, markets already settled will remain settled and all bets will remain valid. Bets in markets that are yet to be determined will be void.



					</p>

					<h2>
						Exchange Runs

					</h2>

					<p style="font-size: 17px; 	font-weight: 300;	line-height: 1.7em;	color: black !important;	text-align: start;">
						Bets are placed in an exchange and matched with corresponding bets.
						Bets will be matched at the requested run line or better.
						All exchange runs are based on decimal odds format.
						All bets are placed at 2.00 odds.
						Bets will be void in the following cases, regardless of whether the outcome of the bet is already unconditionally determined:
						if the scheduled number of overs for the innings is reduced by rain interruption and at settlement time, the actual number of overs bowled is less than the number of overs stipulated for the market; or
						if the scheduled number of overs for the innings is reduced for any other reason after the innings has begun, and at settlement time, the reduced number of scheduled overs is less than the number of overs stipulated for the market.
						Please note that if the batting side reach their target within the total amount of stipulated overs or have been bowled out and the innings hasn?t been reduced in overs to less than the stipulated number of overs for the market, the market will be settled as complete.
